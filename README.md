# Ship and Carrier Management System
This is the repository for the Hull Seals Ship Registration System.

# Description
This repository houses all of the files required to build and host your own version of the Hull Seals Ship Registration System. The system is how we add, delete, and update Seal Ships and Carriers, as a fun, optional project to see what ships our Seals have, what they name them, and assign "Seal Ship Registry Numbers" as in-universe fun Ship IDs.

# Installation

## Requirements
- PHP 5.5+ (7.x+ Recommended)
- An SQL Server with tables to store data (Not Provided)
- A Web server software such as Apache2 or NGIX.
- A JavaScript-enabled browser.

## Usage
To install, download the latest [release](https://gitlab.com/hull-seals-cyberseals/code/ship-and-carrier-management/-/tags) from our repository. Upload and extract the files to the directory or subdirectory you wish to install from, and change the information in db.php to fit your server. Ensure that you have created Stored Procedures and have the appropriate tables. Due to security risks, our own example tables are not provided.

## Troubleshooting
- Upon installation, be sure to replace the information in db.php to match your own details.
- Additionally, be sure to create a database and tables, and method of creating, updating, and removing data. It is encouraged to use Stored Procedures for this task.
- If you are having issues, look through the closed bug reports.
- If no issue is similar, open a new bug report. Be sure to be detailed.

# Support
The best way to receive support is through the issues section of this repository. As every setup is different, support may be unable to help you, but in general we will try when we can.
If for some reason you are unable to do so, emailing us at Code[at]hullseals[dot]space will also reach the same team.

# Roadmap
In the short term, the only major known change upcoming is the establishment of site-wide assets such as headers and footers to standardize some aspects of code, and changing the aspect view to use a center article design.

As always, bugfixes, speed, and stability updates are priorities as discovered, as well as general enhancements over time.
